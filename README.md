## About 
This Flutter-based mobile application serves as the user interface for an IoT-enabled obstacle-avoiding car. It allows users to remotely control the car's movement and monitor actions performed, along with related data such as the author, date, and time — all through a clean and intuitive UI.

### Usage

In order to use the app, first write a name on the text input.

Main options
- **Control Panel**: Use directional buttons to move the car — forward, backward, left, and right — at different angles, and stop when needed.
- **Status Monitor**: View real-time data including executed actions, timestamps, and the user who initiated them. The data refreshes automatically every 5 seconds, but you can tap the floating button to refresh it manually.
- **Modify Query Button**: Toggle the Status Monitor between showing only the most recent action or the last ten actions.
